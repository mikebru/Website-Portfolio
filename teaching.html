                        <p>Allows students to explore experiential and interactive design through the creation of a semester long project of their own design. We will focus equally on the design process as well as producing and deploying our designs to be engaged with. Projects can take the form of art installations, exhibitions, themed attractions, interior design, event design, activations, etc. We will emphasize the pre-visualization of spaces and use 3-D technology to make design choices prior to deployment. In this studio students will focus their energy on creating a substantive project that combines visual thinking, design research, multimodality, interactivity, and storytelling.
